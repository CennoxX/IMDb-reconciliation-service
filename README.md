.NET Core implementation of an OpenRefine reconciliation service that takes IMDb-IDs and reconciles them to their IMDb entry. The Reconciliation Service API provides the Service Metadata, returns the title or name and the url, so that reconciled IMDb-IDs are clickable links. Further it is possible to extend the data by using the JSON-LD data of IMDb with the Data Extension API. The Preview API, Property Proposal API and Suggest API are also implemented.
